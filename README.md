This repository contains two interactive Python GUI applications (GUI_2D) that allow you to simulate and visualize the force between two electrons based on different configurations of atomic lattice vibrations, atomic number, and lattice parameters.
## Features

 ### GUI_2D: Simulates electron interactions in a 2D lattice based on the selected parameters.
  #### Adjustable Parameters:
   - Lattice vibrations
   - Atomic number
   - Lattice parameter
Explore Cooper Pair Formation: Tweak the parameters to explore conditions under which Cooper pairs may form, a key aspect in understanding superconductivity.

    

## Insructions to Use 

Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/adigasuhas/Toy_Model---Superconductivity.git
    cd Toy_Model---Superconductivity

Install the required Python libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib, Tkinter


Run the GUI applications:

    python3 GUI_2D.py
    
## How to Use ?


- Run GUI_2D to start the simulation.
- Run the python code in python3.6 or above
- Use the dropdown or input fields to change the lattice parameters, atomic number, or lattice vibrations.
- Observe the changes in the electron force and lattice structure as you modify the parameters.
- Try different configurations to explore the possibility of Cooper pair formation.
