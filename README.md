# Electron Force Simulation GUI

This repository contains two interactive Python GUI applications (GUI_2D and GUI_3D) that allow you to simulate and visualize the force between two electrons based on different configurations of atomic lattice vibrations, atomic number, and lattice parameters.
Features

    GUI_2D: Simulates electron interactions and generates a 2D lattice based on the selected parameters.
    Adjustable Parameters:
        Lattice vibrations
        Atomic number
        Lattice parameter
    Explore Cooper Pair Formation: Tweak the parameters to explore conditions under which Cooper pairs may form, a key aspect in understanding superconductivity.

## Installation

    Clone this repository:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/electron-force-simulation.git
    cd electron-force-simulation

Install the required Python libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib, Tkinter


Run the GUI applications:

    python3 GUI_2D.py
    
## How to Use


    Open either GUI_2D to start the simulation.
    Run the python code in python3.6 or above
    Use the dropdown or input fields to change the lattice parameters, atomic number, or lattice vibrations.
    Observe the changes in the electron force and lattice structure as you modify the parameters.
    Try different configurations to explore the possibility of Cooper pair formation.

Enjoy Experimenting!

This tool is designed to be interactive and educational. Have fun tweaking the parameters and visualizing the effects on electron forces and lattice structures!

Feel free to tweak this further to suit your style or project specifics!
